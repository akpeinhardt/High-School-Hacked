# High-School-Hacked
This repository is for solutions to common math and physics problems faced by high school students. Programming can be an incredibly useful tool for teaching the thought process behind solving many algebra, calculus, and physics problems. The hope for this repository is that it can be a resource for any teacher, tutor, or parent looking for a way to engage students in STEM.

# Structure
As the repository grows, a larger structure will be imposed. For now, one directory per example will suffice. 

# Contributing
This is an excellent repository for quick and easy contributions, as well as people new to contributing on github or new to a particular programming language. Have an idea for how to solve a problem? Fork the repository, write up your solution in a well named directory, and file a pull request! 

Because this library is meant as a teaching tool, tests and comments are very appreciated. The target audience here is students who may or may not have programming experience, so comments that seem unnecessary to a softare developer or experienced programmer can be very useful to a student. Comments are also a great place to explain the math/physics/etc. behind the program should you choose to do so.

This repository is language agnostic, so please feel free to write examples in the programming language of your choice! Examples with implementations in multiple languages are especially helpful, as they allow students to compare modern programming tools.

# Requests
If you are an educator and would like to request a programmatic solution to a particular problem or problem set, please feel free to file an Issue with a detailed description of what you are looking for.
