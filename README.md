# High-School-Hacked
This repository is for solutions to common math and physics problems faced by high school students. Programming can be an incredibly useful tool for teaching the thought process behind solving many algebra, calculus, and physics problems. The hope for this repository is that it can be a resource for any teacher, tutor, or parent looking for a way to engage students in STEM.
